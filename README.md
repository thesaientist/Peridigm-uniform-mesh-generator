# Peridigm-uniform-mesh-generator

A collection of python scripts and custom modules to generate uniform cubic meshes for use in multiphysics simulator Peridigm. Currently, the generator is equipped to produce text file meshes of cylindrical domains with desired nodesets. In the future, potentially, there may be improvements to add other shapes of domains and other types of meshes.
